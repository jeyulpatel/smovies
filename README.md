Description:

The backend of the movie review application is built using Java and Spring Boot, providing a robust and scalable server-side architecture. The backend is responsible for handling requests from the frontend, interacting with the MongoDB database, and returning data in a format that the frontend can consume.

Key Features:

API Endpoints: A set of RESTful API endpoints for performing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on movie reviews and related data.
Database Integration: Seamless integration with the MongoDB database for storing and retrieving data.
Authentication and Authorization: Implementation of authentication and authorization mechanisms to ensure secure access to the API endpoints.
Error Handling: Robust error handling mechanisms to handle unexpected errors and exceptions.

Technologies Used:

Java: The primary programming language used for building the backend.
Spring Boot: A popular framework for building scalable and robust Java applications.
MongoDB: A NoSQL database used for storing and retrieving data.
